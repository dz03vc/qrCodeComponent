## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Pure CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- This is my second challenge on Frontend Mentor. While it was easier than the "Order Summary Card" challenge, it still provided valuable practice, particularly in solidifying my understanding of Flexbox.
- This time I designed mobile first and then added @media for Desktop version. 

```css
@media (min-width: 376px) {
    .container {
        margin-top: 152px;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

- I really enjoyed how Frontend Mentor works, but now I'll take a break for a week to learn a little of Javascript and after that I'll pick another challenge. I'm open to suggestions;

### Useful resources
